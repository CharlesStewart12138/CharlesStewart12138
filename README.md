This is just a code application library used in science or engineering engineering practice. Most of it focuses on solving practical problems, so it does not pay special attention to the performance evaluation of the code. It only needs to be able to run under appropriate CPU performance.

Please choose carefully if you are a researcher in computer science technology or software development who is dedicated to algorithm research, as they may not be what you need.
